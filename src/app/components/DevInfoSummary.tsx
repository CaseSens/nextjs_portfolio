        Hi, I'm Casey! I'm a 24 year old software developer with a passion for
        programming.
        <br />
        <br />
        I first got into programming at a young age, but only recently started
        taking it seriously.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm always learning new things and working on personal projects!
      </p>
